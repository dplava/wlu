<dcterms:description>These items were fastened together.  The first is a black and white photograph which shows a group of 3 men and 4 women standing outdoors.  It has been cut down.  The handwritten notes on the back were added prior to the photograph being cut so they are incomplete.  Some of the notes are:  "Lewis Perkins" and "Perkins Jr" and "Clarence's Mother's sister Martha."</dcterms:description>
<dcterms:description>The second item is a black and white photograph which shows two men boxing, outdoors in an open field.  The handwritten notes on the back identify the men as "Tom and Nelson" with "at farm" added by a different hand.</dcterms:description>
<dcterms:description>The third item is a handwritten note which reads, "Nannie E. Wood -- Peeking, Clarence M. Wood's Sisters (Top), (others) unknown."</dcterms:description>
